        <h2>Genesis</h2>

        <p>
            It all started with a mix of admiration and frustration. I liked <strong>Bau</strong>,
            <strong>HTMX</strong>, and
            <strong>Juris</strong>. They were elegant, but they were also opinionated—they forced a choice.
        </p>

        <p>
            I didn't want to choose. I wanted a framework that supported <em>all</em> approaches. None of them quite hit
            the mark on their own. Plus, I wanted someonthing nine provided, template literals right inside HTML. I
            wanted a rich component library (with
            charts!) without having to build everything from scratch.
        </p>

        <p>
            I wanted something that felt more like regular HTML than even HTMX does. I wanted an un-opinionated router
            and
            at least partial "automatic" SSR—where code could execute and replace itself on the server with a simple
            DOM emulation.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, I decided to run an experiment. I wanted to test the ability of modern LLMs to generate large volumes of
            cohesive code. I told the Claude Opus 4.5 via Google Antigravity to "create me the combo of HTMX, Bau, and
            Juris with no special attribute names plus HTML template literals. And, give me a UI component library like
            Bau's but dont build it from scratch." I also provied a few examokes of the kind of code I wanter to write.
        </p>

        <p>
            The result is specific yet flexible. It brings together the features I craved without locking you into a
            single paradigm.

            <p style="margin: 0; color: var(--site-text-primary); font-size: 1.25rem; font-style: italic;">
                "My opinion, don't be opinionated!"
