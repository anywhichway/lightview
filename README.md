# lightview v1.7.1b (BETA)

Small, simple, powerful web UI and micro front end creation ...

Great ideas from Svelte, React, Vue and Riot combined into one small tool: < 7.5K (minified/gzipped).

See the docs and examples at [https://lightview.dev](https://lightview.dev).

Meanwhile, here is what you get:

1) Single file and <a href="#local-templates" target=_self>template</a> components.

1) [Sandboxed remote components](https://lightview.dev/#sandboxed-components) and micro front ends</a>.

1) [Unit testable](https://lightview.dev/#unit-testing) components and a [debug mode](https://lightview.dev/#debugging) for using standard JavaScript debuggers</a>.

1) No pre-deployment transpilation/compilation required.

1) Svelte like variable usage, i.e. write your state modifying code like normal code.

1) Extended variable type declarations including `min`, `max` and `step` on `number` or limits on `string` and `array` lengths.

1) [TypeScript like](https://lightview.dev/#variables) runtime type checking of variables in components.

1) Automatic server retrieval and update of variables declared as `remote`.

1) Automatic import, export, cross-component sync, or reactive response to attributes/props/variables. See [superVariable](https://lightview.dev/#super-variable).

1) [Automatic form variable creation and binding](https://lightview.dev/#auto-binding-forms).

1) [Attribute directives](https://lightview.dev/#attribute-directives) like `l-if`, and a single powerful `l-for` that handles array and object keys, values, and entries.

1) Reactive string template literals for content and attribute value replacement.

1) No virtual DOM. The Lightview dependency tracker laser targets just those nodes that need updates.

1) SPA, and MPA friendly ... somewhat SEO friendly and short steps away from fully SEO friendly.

1) A [component library](https://lightview.dev/components) including charts and gauges.

1) Lots of live [editable examples](https://lightview.dev/#examples).
